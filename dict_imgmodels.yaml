# All Img models are fetched via API (A1111 / Forge).

  # Exclude - Omit models which include matching text.

# When changing imgmodels, Presets are scored by matching/failing 'filter', 'exclude', and 'max_filesize' criteria.
# For single model presets (exact_matches), use the 'title' from the values listed here: (http://127.0.0.1:7860/docs#/default/get_sd_models_sdapi_v1_sd_models_get)

# Duplicate and update to add more presets to the list.
# Valid payload options listed here: (http://127.0.0.1:7860/docs#/default/text2imgapi_sdapi_v1_txt2img_post)
# It is recommended to use tag presets for your payload settings *** BUT "width" and "height" are very important here as they affect the '/image' Size options!! ***
