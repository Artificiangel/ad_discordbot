# Update the context with your imgmodels.
# You can get valid model options from here (check PORT): http://127.0.0.1:7860/docs#/default/get_sd_models_sdapi_v1_sd_models_get (Try it Out > Execute)

# **Regarding Backslashes "\" in model path:
# - Use a single slash, not "\\"
# - Until this PR is applied to textgen-webui, model path cannot be parsed by 'grammar_utils.py' (the grammar_string)
#   You can add the 2 lines of code to grammar_utils.py and then model path can parse without error.
